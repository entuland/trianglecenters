# Triangle Centers
The Centers of a Triangle

Why?
----

Well, this is an old program I've implemented using C++ and the SDL library
(version 1) when I started learning C++ several years ago.


I think I could have some issues understanding parts of the code I've written 
myself, and sometimes in the future I might extend these instructions to include
the steps to compile it from scratch, for the moment, it's up to you to find out
how to compile it, if you're interested :)

Cheers!

Francesco
